        <p>Hey, I'm Mar Thayne Lowell Nacionales, pleased to meet you! Manila is where I've spent all of my 23 years, and I wouldn't have it any other way. Guitar strumming and exploring new places are what keep me ticking. Right now, I'm knee-deep in web development studies through BYU-Idaho's online program, a challenging but rewarding journey. When I'm not buried in code, I love capturing moments on camera, pouring my thoughts into poems, and pedaling through Manila's bustling streets on my trusty bike. My main focus? To see through my education and turn my aspirations into reality. Proudly served in the Philippines Baguio Mission, where I learned countless life lessons. From the incredible people I met to the rich culture I immersed myself in, my mission taught me the values of empathy, resilience, and adaptability. It ignited a deep appreciation for diversity and strengthened my determination to make a positive impact wherever I go. My mission experiences continue to inspire me as I pursue my dreams with passion and purpose. One verse from the Book of Mormon that resonates deeply with me is from Alma 37:6: "By small and simple things are great things brought to pass." This scripture reminds me that even the smallest actions and efforts can lead to significant and meaningful outcomes. My ultimate goal is to live by this principle, to persevere through my studies, and to see my dreams come to fruition.</p>
